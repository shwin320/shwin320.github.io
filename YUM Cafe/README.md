This is my entry into the 2021 PA FBLA Project, for the category of Website Design.
The project was to design a website for a business (real or fictitious), which includes the name, photos, and description for the buisness. The website must also include a minimum of four web pages, including a contact us page and embedded features. The website also needs to include social media and marketing materials.

# Our Story
Our story begins 40 years ago, in the South Indian state of Kerala. There, Ajay Varghese was born. From when he was very young, he dreamed of one day cooking delicious food and making people happy. When he was 20, Ajay immigrated to the United States, building a life in New York. In 2008, he moved to Huntingdon Valley with his young family: his wife, Anjali, and son, Aaron. As he grew up, Aaron loved eating classic American foods, such as chicken fingers and hamburgers. But he also loved eating some of Indian foods that Ajay made for his family, such as naan with paneer curry. In 2012, seeing how much his family enjoyed his food, he decided to make his age-old dream a reality. In October of 2012, YUM Cafe opened its doors. From the very beginning, YUM Cafe has made it its mission to follow Ajay’s dream of serving delicious food that makes others happy. We also continue serving the best of Ajay’s two worlds: delicious American food and delicious Indian food. Ajay, Anjali, and Aaron continue to run YUM Cafe, making sure that our mission continues.
